FRC Team 2809 Scouting DataBase 2013 Ultimate Ascent

Instructions

Before using:
-Open open_dp.py in the editor and change the name of the
 database to what you intend to use
-Run matchentry_cmd.py, enter clear to finish setup of the
 new database
-It is now ready for inputting and outputting data
  

Using matchentry_cmd.py:
-Go slow, wrong data isn't very useful
-To enter data type "input" and press enter
-Enter the red teams first, it's just hardcoded that way
-When you are done entering data type "save" and press
 enter, this should be done after every match if possible
-The one other thing that you can do with this program is
 type "output" and it will print a messy version of the
 data you have entered in the order it was entered, this
 is easier to handle in the sqlite viewer program.
